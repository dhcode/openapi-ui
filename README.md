# OpenAPI UI

An documentation UI and API Console with focus on [Swagger v2 and OpenAPI v3 RESTful API specifications](https://swagger.io/specification/).

This UI is inspired by the [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) project, but is more focused on doing API requests.

It is developed as Angular Library and Angular App.

## Current state

This project is currently **in development**. It is not intended for production use.
But you can try it out and see if it works with your API specification.
