# OpenAPI Viewer Components

This Angular library contains components to show API documentation based on [Swagger v2 and OpenAPI v3 RESTful API specifications](https://swagger.io/specification/).

This UI is inspired by the [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) project, but is more focused on doing API requests.
